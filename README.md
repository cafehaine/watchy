# Watchy
This is my custom firmware for the Watchy: https://watchy.sqfmi.com/

It's written in C, and has for goals to:
- Have a simulator to enable faster development
- Support BLE communications with phones, using the same protocols as AsteroidOS: https://wiki.asteroidos.org/index.php/BLE_profiles
